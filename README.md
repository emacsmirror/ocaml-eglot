# ocaml-eglot

**`ocaml-eglot`** is a lightweight
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) **minor mode** designed
to enhance the experience of writing OCaml code by leveraging the
[**Eglot**](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eglot.html)
[Language Server
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) (LSP)
client. This tool specifically caters to the OCaml ecosystem by
implementing canonical custom requests and commands exposed by the
[**`ocaml-lsp-server`**](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp).

`ocaml-eglot` bridges the gap between generic LSP support and the
**specific needs of OCaml developers**. Its tight coupling with Eglot
ensures a lightweight experience without sacrificing the advanced
features made available by `ocaml-lsp-server`. Its aim is to offer a
user experience as close as possible to that offered by the Emacs mode
[Merlin](https://ocaml.github.io/merlin/editor/emacs/).

## Features

### Browsing errors

Eglot relies on
[Flymake](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Flymake.html)
for error diagnosis. OCaml-eglot offers two functions for quickly
navigating through errors:

- `ocaml-eglot-error-next` (<kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>C-x</kbd>) To jump to
  the next error
- `ocaml-eglot-error-prev` (<kbd>C-c</kbd> <kbd>C-c</kbd>) To jump to
  the previous error
